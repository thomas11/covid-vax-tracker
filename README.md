# About

This is a Twitter bot to track how far the United States are towards having most of the population vaccinated against COVID-19. The current incarnation is [covid_vax_wa](https://twitter.com/covid_vax_wa) and tracks the US as a whole, and Washington State.

Once a weekday (or when I choose to run it), it retrieves data from the [CDC COVID Data Tracker](https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#vaccinations). It then extracts and tweets the percentage of the population who have received both doses of either Pfizer or Moderna and are therefore fully vaccinated.

# Tech

The bot is written in [F#](https://fsharp.org/) and runs on [Azure Functions](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/functions/) using the timer trigger.

As a newbie to F#, many thanks to Scott Wlaschin for the https://fsharpforfunandprofit.com. `F# |> I â™¥`

Disclaimer: I work at Microsoft, but this a personal project with no relation to my job, which is unrelated to F# or Functions.
